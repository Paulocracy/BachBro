Each Recipient is solely responsible for determining the appropriateness of using and distributing the Program and assumes all risks associated with its exercise of rights under this Agreement, including but not limited to the risks and costs of program errors, compliance with applicable laws, damage to or loss of data, programs or equipment, and unavailability or interruption of operations.

E. TRADEMARK

1. The MusicXML™ Mark (or a derivative Mark, such as MusicXML™ Plus) may not be used to identify any product or service not originating from or licensed by Copyright Holder without specific, written prior permission.

2. This License does not grant any rights to use any other trademarks owned by Copyright Holder, including without limitation "Recordare®", "Dolet®", and "In the Beginning Was the Note®", even if such marks are included in the Program. For purposes of clarification and the avoidance of doubt, the trademarks "Recordare®", "Dolet®", and "In the Beginning Was the Note®" must not be used to endorse or promote Contributor versions of the Program without the prior written permission of Copyright Holder.

3. All rights not expressly granted herein by Copyright Holder with respect to the MusicXML™ Mark or any other trademarks owned by Copyright Holder are reserved by and to Copyright Holder.
