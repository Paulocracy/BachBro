1. Introduction
You downloaded BachBro in one of the two provided ways: With
binaries (currently .exe files for Windows, created with pyinstaller), or without.
 In the former case, you can skip chapter 2 and proceed with chapters
3, 4 and 5 in order to run BachBro with all of its
functions.
 In the latter case, you have to follow the instructions of chapter 2 in
order to run BachBro.

2. How to install the Python prerequisites (only necessary if no binary of
   BachBro was downloaded)
2.1 Python
BachBro is tested and mainly programmed in Python 3.5. You have
to install Python >=3.5 on your system in order to be able to run
BachBro. Older Python 3 versions may work, but are untested.
You can download Python from https://www.python.org/ (Accessed in November 2016)

2.2 tkinter
The graphical user interface uses the "tkinter" Python module. If not done yet, you have to
install this Python module too. On Linux systems, it is very likely that your
distribution has a package for it. On Windows systems, it is usually installed
with the standard Python installer. If these way's didn't work, you can install
tkinter via pip with the "pip --install tkinter" command. pip itself is aleady installed
alongside with Python.

2.3 pyaudio
The recording from the microphone for the aubio note analysis is done with
the help of the Python module "pyaudio". Run the pip console command
"pip --install pyaudio" to install it.

PyAudio's website is

3. aubio
aubio is an external project which is called by BachBro in order to
recognize notes from audio.
 You have to install or unpack the 'aubio' package for your operating system
or distribution. For Windows, you just have to download one of the Windows
archives.
 If no such package is provided for your system, you may try to compile aubio from
its source. Read aubio's documentation for more information about it.
 After you have installed or unpacked aubio on your system, you have to select
aubio's "aubionotes" command (on Windows the path of the "aubionotes.exe") via
BachBro's menu entry "Edit->Set aubio command...". Simply type in
the correct aubionotes command (Read chapter 4 to find out how to start
BachBro).
 As of November 2016, aubio's website is
https://www.aubio.org/ (Accessed in November 2016)

4. An external scorewriter
All scale/chord samples and recognized notes from audio sources are shows
as MusicXML files. These files contain information for music scores. In
order to be able to view MusicXMLs as as actual scores, you have (if you
didn't do it already) to install a scorewriter.
One free and open-source scorewriter is MuseScore. As of November 2016,
you can find and download it under
 https://www.musescore.org/
You can also use any other MusicXML-compatible scorewriter of your choice.
 After you have installed a scorewriter on your system, you have to make
BachBro aware of it. To do it, you have to write the scorewriter's
command (on Windows, you have to write the scorewriter's .exe) into the
text field that you can access in MusicianAssistan's menu via
"Edit->Set scorewriter command...".
 As you made BachBro aware of the scorewriter, BachBro
will open every newly generated MusicXML with the selected scorewriter.

5. How to execute BachBro after the prerequisites's installation
4.1 If a binary was downloaded
Simply double click on the binary to run BachBro.

4.2 If no binary was downloaded
After Python, tkinter and pyaudio were installed, you can start BachBro
in 2 ways:
 i)  Double click on musician_assistant.py. If Python is registered to 
     .py files, BachBro starts.
 ii) Open your system's console in BachBro's path and run the command
     "python musician_assistant.py".
