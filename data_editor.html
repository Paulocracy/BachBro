<!--
Together with data_editor.js in the "submodules" subfolder, this is
BachBro data editor's source code.
You need a modern web browser in order to run the data editor. E.g.,
this editor was tested with Mozilla Firefox >=50. You have to allow
JavaScript and pop-ups for this file within your modern web browser.

In this HTML file, the basic elements "caption", "file" and "edit" are
set. "caption" and "file" are shown, if a user chooses a BachBro
data file. "edit" is shown, if such a file is edited.
Most elements are generated in the JavaScript part of this program.

The data files are used by BachBro. BachBro's source code
starting point is "musician_assistant.py".
